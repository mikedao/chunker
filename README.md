# CHUNKER TIME

This was an actual programming challenge that I was asked in an interview.

## The Setup

We are working with a piece of hardware that can only accept inputs in small amounts.
You want to send strings to it in five character chunks.

Create a method that when given a lengthy string, will break it up into an array where
each element consists of a string of five characters.

**DO NOT USE ENUMERABLES**
## Bonus Try Hard
Have the method allow you to change the size of the chunks.
